                 <h1>Erik Johansson</h1> </a>

                <br>
                  
                  <p><h4>Erik Johansson is a Swedish photographer and visual artist. 
                     He is famous for creating surreal worlds through photo combinations. 
                     He strives to create realistic but impossible images 
                     through his camera and imagination.</h4></p>
        
                  
                  <br>

                  <p>He is my most favorite visual artist. 
                     His photos always have excellent light and shadow contrasts, 
                     using reality as the background to create thought-provoking 
                     non-realistic photos. These photos always provide me with 
                     creative inspiration and guide me to think about design 
                     from different perspectives.

                  <h1>Lauren Hom</h1>
               </a>
               <br>

                  <p><h4>Lauren is a designer and font artist born in California. 
                     She is particularly outstanding in font design. 
                     She likes to use bright colors and playful font graffiti 
                     to inject a clean, joyful, and free feeling into her designs. 
                     She has collaborated with many well-known companies such 
                     as Starbucks, Google, Adobe, etc.</h4>
                  </p>
                  <br>

                  <p>Lauren's works can impress people and make them fall in love 
                     immediately. She is always able to decorate words into a beautiful 
                     painting, and she can also combine various fonts to create a 
                     unified design. The fonts she designs are always very playful, 
                     coupled with bright colors, making me feel that the entire 
                     design process is joyful. I hope to learn how to make designs 
                     look enjoyable.

                  <h1>Kurzgesagt</h1>
         
               </a>
               <br>
                  <p><h4>Kurzgesagt was initially a passionate project after graduating from university. 
                     The original intention was to create scientific videos in a way that is not 
                     dull and boring, exploring knowledge from a new perspective. It features 
                     very bright color schemes, exquisite animated videos, and easy and fun 
                     voiceovers, making it the most popular educational channel on YouTube.
                  </h4>
                  </p>
                  <br>

                  <p>It is a YouTube channel that I discovered from videos of my biology classes. 
                     It uses vector graphics to create highly detailed and intricate animated videos, 
                     combining various bright colors to match perfectly. 
                     It is a work that always amazes me every time I watch it. It is very worth learning from.
