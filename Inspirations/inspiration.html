                     <h1>Erik Johansson</h1>   
   
                  </a>

                  <p>He is my favorite visual artist. He has created many imaginative 
                  surreal photography works. His works combine many surreal yet 
                  realistic ideas, excellent light and shadow expression, 
                  realistic post production, and each piece has unexpected gains. 
                  He taught me to think creatively from many different perspectives.

                  wooden desktop. The white artistic text is decorated with
                  various green leaves, orange and red fruits. The poster is
                  surrounded by painting materials.">

                  <h1>Lauren Hom</h1>
                  

               </a>

                  <p>She is a graphic designer from Southern California. 
                  I really like her font design and illustrations. 
                  Her works always use bright colors and beautiful 
                  typography that exudes a sense of life, always 
                  giving me a strong urge to follow the production 
                  process

                  <img src="img/kurzgesagt.png" alt="There are several 
                  high saturation pictures hanging on an Aegean Blue wall,
                  below a long black tabletop, there are plants, stationery, 
                  and books placed.">

                  <h1>Kurzgesagt</h1>
         
               </a>
   
                  <p>It is a website that I discovered from videos of 
                  biology classes. Its original intention was to 
                  spread science through interesting visuals. 
                  However, they chose colorful and highly 
                  saturated colors to create their videos 
                  and website, which were eye-catching and 
                  impressive. I gained a lot of color 
                  inspiration from it, and also learned 
                  a lot of scientific knowledge.
