                <h1> This is Ling Zhou </h1>
                <br>
                <br>

                <p>Ling believes that everything in the world can be an 
                inspiration for design. She loves photography and 
                seeks out the uniqueness of the subject through the 
                lens. She enjoys this process of searching and 
                discovering. She prefers the process of a design 
                being born in her own hands.
            
                
                <br>   
                Ling grew up in a small family in China and developed
                a strong interest in painting from a young age.
                After growing up, she became a designer. She 
                developed her passion for painting into her 
                profession and found happiness and satisfaction 
                in her work.

                <br>
                <br>

                Then, when Ling immigrated to the United States, 
                her life underwent significant changes as she 
                became a mother of three children. The responsibility
                of moving to a new country and raising a family has 
                brought her new challenges. Balancing family and 
                personal aspirations is very difficult, so she can 
                only give up her dreams. Just occasionally find a 
                hint of comfort while accompanying children in 
                painting or handicrafts.     

                <br>
                <br>

                As the children grew up and started going to school, 
                she had her own time and went to community college 
                to study. At first, it was just to improve her 
                language skills, but she went to a painting class, 
                which reignited her passion for design and made her 
                want to create with her own hands again. This 
                experience was another turning point in her life, 
                which strengthened her determination to continue 
                her career in design. Ling received support from 
                her family and began to immerse herself in her busy 
                life and studies. Now, she has successfully transferred 
                from community college to a four-year university, getting
                closer and closer to her dream.

                <br>
                <br>

                Ling hopes to return to design, not only to revive her 
                career, but also to rediscover herself. She hopes 
                to become a mother who can also make her children 
                proud. She is getting closer and closer on this road now
